# Memory Recall

Quickly load relevant context from the memory vault.

## Instructions

1. Read the main memory index:
   - `memory/index.md`

2. Read the memory log for recent activity:
   - `memory/memory-log.md`

3. Read core context files:
   - `memory/context/project-overview.md`
   - `memory/context/tech-stack.md`

4. If the user mentioned a specific topic, search for relevant memories:
   - Use Grep to search `memory/` for keywords
   - Read matching entity, pattern, or context files

5. Summarize what you found:
   - Key context loaded
   - Recent session activity
   - Relevant patterns or entities for current work

## Output Format

Provide a brief summary:

```
## Memory Loaded

**Context:** [key points from context files]

**Recent Activity:** [from memory-log]

**Relevant Memories:**
- [entity/pattern names with brief descriptions]
```

Keep the summary concise - the goal is quick orientation, not exhaustive detail.
